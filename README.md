# info
A fun idea I had, I thought it might be a useful debugging tool to see a live patch of code being run in different spots in it's code.

# installation
Just open index.html in a browser and you'll see what's going on

What's missing:
- better indenting
- reflection (ability to run this on itself)
- adding functions that run out of scope
